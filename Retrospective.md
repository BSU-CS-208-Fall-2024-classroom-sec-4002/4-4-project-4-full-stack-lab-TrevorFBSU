## Experience

- For this lab I definatly had to do a little digging. I understood what needed to be done it was more about how to actually do it. I had to revisit some of the reading assignments as well as do a little googling to figure out how to complete the server.js code. But eventually I got it up and running. Overall this lab was the most difficult and posed the most challenge but I had fun getting it all connected together and working.

## Known issues or Bugs

No known issues or bugs detected during or after coding.

## Sources used

Modular Reading Assignments. Node.js/sqlite api, stack overflow
